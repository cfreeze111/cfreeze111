### Hi Everyone!

### I want to introduce myself to every visitor for a  better understand😊

#### Introducing myself

##### I am in the mood for like-mind colleague and would love to hear from you about our future.

I'm a graduation student who graduate from YanShan University and major in computer science.Honestly,I am very efficient in writing code.

When I was a freshman, I already understood that computer science is a practical discipline. As a result, I dedicated myself to writing better code. 

This motivated me to join the **RoboMASTER club**. 

During the club's interview process, I managed to grasp the basics of **OpenCV** and **C++** in about 10 days. Within 3 days, I completed **my first-ever project: license plate recognition**, which looked like this [用形态学及HSV完成车牌照识别_cfreeze的博客-CSDN博客](https://blog.csdn.net/qq_51942219/article/details/114002399?spm=1001.2014.3001.5501)   *(*  I'm aware that the industry generally considers **CSDN to be a shit mountain**, so in the future, I plan to publish related content on GitHub using **Sourcetree** and manage it using **Git**.  *)*  , and I first use **typora** for document writing. Furthermore, I also employed **Processon** for creating diagrams. Though looking back, I realize that all aspects were quite basic and easy.

Later on, I also delved into foundational knowledge like **data structures, Java, assembly language, algorithms, and multi-threading (Windows, Qt, Linux)**, and completed various  projects.

So I believe you should have a very basic impression of me. Feel free to take a look at my GitHub and provide valuable feedback.😊

P.S. If the text above looks like something confused, that is caused by my poor English, which has been always troubling me and my teacher.
